# Finance-Assistant
A clean and friendly personal finance tool that helps you actually see where your money's going — and maybe even save some of it too. Built for everyday use, this project gives you a full snapshot of your financial habits without the clutter. 

# What It Does
At its core, Finance Tracker is a web app designed to simplify your money life. Whether you’re tracking your daily coffee spending or just trying to make rent on time, this tool makes it easy to:
- **Get a Dashboard View**: Instantly see your current balance, how much you've earned and spent this month, and how your money breaks down by category — all in one place.
- **Manually Input Finances**: Enter your balance and each transaction manually, so you're always aware of what’s coming in and what’s going out.
- **Categorize with Style**: Add your own spending or income categories, and see them reflected in clean, colorful pie charts.
- **Visualize by Month**: Browse through past activity, view monthly summaries, and compare trends over time.
- **Split the Essentials**: Transactions are automatically sorted into income and expenses, giving you a clear view of where your money stands.
# Some Extra Features
**Goal Tracking** - Because we all need a little motivation sometimes.

With the finance goals feature, you can set targets — like staying under $200 on dining out or saving up $1000 over the semester — and Finance Tracker will keep an eye on things. If you’re getting close to your limit, it’ll give you a heads-up so you can course-correct before things go off the rails.

## Want to see how your finances actually add up? This project’s here to help — no judgment, just clarity.
